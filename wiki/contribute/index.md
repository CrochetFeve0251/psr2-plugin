## Contribute

Launchpad is an open source project so anyone can contribute to it.

Contributing is even more important than this as it is what keeps the project alive.

## Companies

For companies, it is not yet possible to contribute by sponsoring the project.

Instead, it is possible to contribute by sponsoring some developers to work on the project or by allowing some of their developers to allocate a part of their working time on the project.

## Contributor

Contributing on Launchpad can take multiple forms which are all necessary to the good functioning of the project.
