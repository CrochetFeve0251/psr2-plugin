Launchpad is framework that tries to keep the lowest footprint on your performance and memory. That's why we made the choice to ship only the essential code as the default configuration.

However as every good Framework it is still possible to cover a large amount of usage by installing modules.

For that we created a system of libraries interacting with an installer Library in the framework code that makes the installation from each module you install automatically.
