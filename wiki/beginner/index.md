# Beginner documentation

Beginning with a new framework or technology is always hard.

That is why Launchpad tries to assist you while you are acquiring its bases.

For that it uses a couple of methods:

## The beginner documentation

Knowing the whole framework by heart is not required to start developing with it.

That is why we provide you with a beginner documentation that contains only the notions you need to start.

### The handbook

The handbook is a quick way to learn to create your first plugin and cover all notions you might need doing so.

[Check the handbook](./handbook/index.md)

### The plugin life circle

Working with a plugin is different from working with a web application.

That is why a small documentation about the basic states of a WordPress plugin is available.

[Check the documentation](./plugin-life-circle/index.md)

## Example projects

Sometimes templates are not enough to understand what is going on.

This is why we introduced examples from which the templates are extracted.
That way it is possible for you to have full context on any example from the documentation.

## PHPStan rules

Documentation has one default, you need to use the right terms to find what you need.

That is why Launchpad is shipped with a set of custom PHPStan rules that analyze your code and help you to take advantage from the framework whenever this is possible.

To run theses rules you can run the following script in any Launchpad project:

```composer run run-stan```
